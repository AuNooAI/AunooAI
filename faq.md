#### **FAQ:** : Why DO Some Models Return Unexpected Formatting in Responses, and How Can I Fix It?

**Issue:**\
Issue: Sometimes, responses from models, for example Claude-3.7, can contain unexpected formatting, such as headers (using # and ##) or bold text (\*\*). This can cause issues when viewing or processing the information in the app.

**Why This Happens:**\
Claude-3.7 occasionally adds formatting to improve readability, but this might not always be compatible with the way the app displays or processes content.

**What You Can Do:**

1. **Adjust the Prompt via Settings:**
   * If you use the model frequently, you can adjust the prompt to prevent unexpected formatting:
     * Go to **“Settings”** > **“Prompt Manager”** and edit the prompt to include instructions like:\
       &#xNAN;_“Please return responses without any markdown formatting.”_
   * This can help standardize the output format.
2. **Refresh and Retry:**
   * If you notice unusual formatting, try refreshing the page or resubmitting your query. Temporary glitches can sometimes cause this issue.
3. **Contact Support:**
   * If the issue persists, reach out to our support team with details of the query that caused the problem. This helps us improve and potentially fix the issue in future updates.

**Summary:**\
Unexpected formatting can occur due to how Claude-3.7 generates responses. Adjusting the prompt via **“Settings” > “Prompt Manager”**, refreshing the page, or updating the app are simple ways to resolve it. If the problem continues, our support team is here to help!
