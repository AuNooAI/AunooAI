IDENTIFY 3-4 CONSENSUS CATEGORIES:\n   - Look for themes where multiple sources agree (even if phrased differently)\n   - Calculate consensus percentage based on actual source agreement\n   - Don't just list what sources say - identify PATTERNS across sources\n   - Each category should represent a distinct area of agreement/disagreement\n\n2. QUANTIFY EVERYTHING ACCURATELY:\n   - Consensus confidence = (# sources supporting view) / (total sources) * 100\n   - Source percentages for outliers must be realistic (typically 5-25%)\n   - Sentiment distribution must sum to 100%\n   - Timeline distribution must sum to 100%\n   - Count articles_analyzed for each category\n\n3. CROSS-REFERENCE SOURCES:\n   - Each category must cite at least 3-5 supporting articles in 6_key_articles\n   - Descriptions should reference specific sources: \"According to Article A..., corroborated by Article B...\"\n   - Identify both majority and minority positions\n   - Include actual article titles and URLs from provided data\n\n4. EXTRACT 4-6 KEY INSIGHTS (top-level):\n   - These should reveal cross-cutting patterns across ALL categories\n   - Include compelling statistics or data points\n   - Show unexpected agreements or surprising disagreements\n   - Each insight should synthesize multiple sources\n\n5. IDENTIFY OUTLIERS PER CATEGORY (ONLY IF GENUINELY PRESENT):\n   - Optimistic outliers (4_optimistic_outliers) = minority views predicting faster/better outcomes\n   - Pessimistic outliers (5_pessimistic_outliers) = minority views predicting slower/worse outcomes\n   - ONLY include outliers if sources genuinely present dissenting views (>5% of sources)\n   - May have 0-3 optimistic outliers and 0-3 pessimistic outliers per category\n   - DO NOT fabricate outliers if sources show strong consensus\n   - Calculate what % of sources hold each outlier view (must be realistic: 5-25%)\n   - Be specific about years and scenarios\n   - Each outlier must cite actual sources from the data\n\n6. STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS (7_strategic_implications):\n   - For each category, explain organizational impact for {org_name} (a {org_type} organization)\n   - What actions should {org_name} take within their sphere of influence?\n   - What risks or opportunities does this reveal for a {org_type} organization?\n   - Be specific and actionable, tailored to {org_type} capabilities\n\n7. KEY DECISION WINDOWS (8_key_decision_windows) - 3-5 per category:\n   - CRITICAL: All actions must be appropriate for a {org_type} organization\n   - Identify specific time-sensitive action points that {org_name} can realistically execute\n   - Urgency levels: Critical (red), High (orange), Medium (blue), Low (gray)\n   - Assign realistic timeframes: Immediate (0-6 months), Short-term (6-18 months), Mid-term (18-36 months)\n   - Specify owners using roles appropriate for {org_type} organizations\n   - Define measurable success metrics relevant to {org_type} work\n   - Note any dependencies or prerequisites\n   - Make actions concrete and executable within {org_type} organizational capabilities\n\n8. TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS (9_timeframe_analysis) per category:\n   - Break down implications across three timeframes:\n   - **Immediate (0-6 months)**: What needs to happen right now? Urgent decisions, immediate actions\n   - **Short-term (6-18 months)**: Strategic positioning, capability building, resource allocation\n   - **Mid-term (18-36 months)**: Long-term preparation, transformation initiatives, competitive positioning\n   - Identify 2-3 key milestones within the consensus timeline with specific years\n   - For each milestone, explain its significance and what it means for the organization\n\n9. TIMELINE CONSENSUS (2_timeline_consensus):\n   - Calculate realistic distribution across time periods based on article data\n   - consensus_window should capture the PRIMARY timeframe where most impact is expected\n   - IMPORTANT: start_year should reflect when impact BEGINS to manifest (can be > 2025, NOT always 2025)\n   - start_year and end_year define the thick colored bar on the timeline visualization (2025-2050 range)\n   - Example: If impact mainly occurs 2030-2040, use start_year: 2030, end_year: 2040\n   - Make sure this aligns with the distribution percentages\n\n10. CONSENSUS TYPE (1_consensus_type):\n   - Choose the type that best represents the nature of this consensus category\n   - Calculate accurate sentiment distribution from articles (positive, neutral, critical)\n   - CRITICAL: Distribution values MUST sum to 100 (they are percentages, not decimals or counts)\n   - Example: {{\"positive\": 60, \"neutral\": 30, \"critical\": 10}} (sums to 100)\n   - Confidence level should reflect strength of agreement (typically 60-95%)\n\nQUALITY REQUIREMENTS:\n- Every claim must reference specific sources\n- Percentages must be calculated from actual article counts and be realistic\n- Descriptions must synthesize across sources, not just summarize one\n- Timeline predictions must be grounded in source data\n- No generic statements - be specific and evidence-based\n- All article references in 6_key_articles must use real titles and URLs from data\n- Outliers should be genuinely different perspectives, not just variations\n\nARTICLE DATA FOR ANALYSIS:\n{articles}\n\nNUMBERED ARTICLE LIST (Use these numbers for citations):\n{article_references}\n\nSTRATEGIC FOCUS: {prompt_focus}\n\nNow analyze these articles and return ONLY the JSON object with the Auspex numbered field structure. Focus on SYNTHESIS across sources, not individual summaries.",
