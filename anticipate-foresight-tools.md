### Troubleshooting

**No analysis appearing:**

* Verify you have articles for the selected topic (check Explore)
* Ensure date range contains articles
* Check Operations HQ for system health
* Try a different AI model if one is failing

**Analysis seems generic:**

* Narrow your date range (fewer, more focused articles)
* Use an organization profile for tailored insights
* Choose a more specific topic
* Increase article count in settings

**Takes too long to generate:**

* Large date ranges (30+ days) can take 2-3 minutes
* High article counts increase processing time
* Some AI models are slower than others
* Be patient—complex analysis takes time

**Can't save dashboard:**

* You may not have write permissions
* Dashboard name may conflict with existing one
* Try logging out and back in
* Check browser console for errors
