# Getting Started with Narrative View

## Overview

**Narrative View** reveals the story behind the news. This AI-powered feature analyzes themes, patterns, and key developments across your selected articles to help you understand the bigger picture in threat intelligence reporting.

## What is Narrative View?

Narrative View goes beyond individual articles to identify:

- **Thematic Clusters**: Related articles grouped by shared themes and narratives
- **Emerging Patterns**: Connections and trends across multiple stories
- **Key Insights**: AI-generated summaries highlighting important developments
- **Research Angles**: Suggested areas for deeper investigation

## How to Use Narrative View

### Step 1: Select Your Focus

1. Navigate to the **Narrative Explorer** tab in the main navigation
2. Click on the **Narratives** sub-tab (lightbulb icon)
3. Use the filters at the top of the page to select:
   - **Topics**: Choose one or more threat intelligence categories
   - **Date Range**: Select the time period to analyze (recommended: 3-7 days for focused insights)

### Step 2: Generate Insights

1. Click the **Generate Narrative Insights** button
2. Wait while the AI analyzes your selected articles (this may take 30-60 seconds)
3. Results will appear as interactive cards on the page

### Step 3: Explore Results

Each narrative card shows:

- **Theme Title**: A descriptive name for the narrative cluster
- **Summary**: AI-generated overview of the key developments
- **Related Articles**: Links to source articles that support this narrative
- **Research Suggestions**: Recommended follow-up questions and investigation angles

## Best Practices

### Start Focused

Begin with a narrow scope for the most relevant insights:
- Select 1-3 related topics
- Use a 3-7 day date range
- Review results, then expand your search if needed

### Compare Time Periods

Run narrative analysis across different time windows to identify:
- How stories evolve over time
- Emerging vs. declining themes
- Shifts in threat actor behavior or tactics

### Combine with Other Views

Use Narrative View alongside:
- **Article Investigator**: For detailed article-by-article review
- **Highlights**: For specific incident tracking
- **Investigators**: For custom monitoring and alerts

## Tips & Tricks

- **Refresh Regularly**: Re-run analysis after new articles arrive to catch breaking developments
- **Export Results**: Use the export options to save insights for reports or presentations
- **Cross-Reference**: Click through to related articles to verify AI interpretations
- **Refine Filters**: Narrow your topic selection if results feel too broad or unfocused

## Common Use Cases

### Threat Hunting
Identify emerging threat patterns across multiple APT groups or attack campaigns.

### Strategic Analysis
Understand geopolitical narratives affecting the threat landscape (e.g., nation-state activities).

### Executive Briefings
Generate high-level summaries of the week's most important threat intelligence developments.

### Research Planning
Discover gaps in coverage and prioritize areas for deeper investigation.

## Troubleshooting

**No results appearing?**
- Verify you have articles in the selected date range and topics
- Try expanding your date range or topic selection
- Check that filters are not excluding all articles

**Results seem too generic?**
- Narrow your topic selection to more specific categories
- Reduce the date range for more focused analysis
- Try filtering by specific sources or entities

**Analysis taking too long?**
- Large date ranges (30+ days) with many topics can take 2-3 minutes
- Consider breaking the analysis into smaller time windows
- Check your internet connection if the request times out
