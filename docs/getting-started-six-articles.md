# Getting Started with Six Articles

## Overview

**Six Articles** is your executive briefing tool—designed to transform overwhelming threat intelligence feeds into a curated, actionable digest for senior leadership. This AI-powered feature selects and analyzes the most strategically relevant articles, providing executive-level insights in a format optimized for time-constrained decision-makers.

## What is Six Articles?

Six Articles delivers research-backed intelligence curation:

- **Smart Selection**: AI identifies the most relevant articles from your data set
- **Executive Analysis**: Each article includes strategic takeaways, actions, and impact assessments
- **Persona-Specific**: Tailored insights for CEO, CTO, CISO, or CMO perspectives
- **Time-Optimized**: 8-12 minute reading experience for morning briefings
- **Export-Ready**: One-click export to Markdown, HTML, PDF, or audio podcast

## Why "Six" Articles?

The number isn't arbitrary—it's backed by research:

- **Cognitive Load**: Executives can effectively process 5-9 distinct items (Miller's Law)
- **Diversity**: Six articles cover multiple domains without overwhelming
- **Time Constraint**: Six curated articles take 8-12 minutes to read
- **Decision Quality**: Research shows decision quality plateaus after 5-7 data points

According to the [Stagwell "Future of News" Study](https://www.stagwellglobal.com/ceos-and-board-directors-view-news-media-as-powerful-advertising-tool-to-influence-key-stakeholders-and-say-brand-safety-is-overapplied-reveals-stagwell-future-of-news-stgw-study), CEOs and board directors view news media as a powerful tool for:
- **Forecasting**: Identifying emerging trends before they become mainstream

## Understanding Article Selection

The AI selects articles based on a sophisticated scoring system:

### Selection Criteria

1. **Relevance**: How well the article matches your topics and persona priorities
2. **Novelty**: Is this new information or rehashing known facts?
3. **Credibility**: How trustworthy is the source?
4. **Representativeness**: Does it represent a broader trend or isolated incident?
5. **Strategic Impact**: Will this affect business decisions or operations?

### What Gets Filtered Out

- Duplicate coverage of the same story
- Low-credibility sources
- Off-topic articles (even if in your date range)
- Purely tactical/technical details without strategic implications
- Opinion pieces without actionable intelligence

## Troubleshooting

**No articles generated?**
- Verify you have articles loaded for the selected date range and topics
- Try expanding your date range (e.g., last 48 hours instead of last 24)
- Check that at least 3-4 topics are selected
- Click "Load Articles" first in Article Investigator to confirm data availability

**Analysis seems generic or off-target?**
- Switch to a more specific persona (CISO instead of CEO for security focus)
- Narrow your topic selection to 3-5 highly relevant categories
- Use the Config modal to customize the system prompt
- Try regenerating—AI results can vary

**Generation taking too long?**
- Large date ranges (7+ days) with many topics can take 60-90 seconds
- Check your internet connection
- Try reducing the number of articles (6 → 4)
- Refresh the page if it exceeds 2 minutes

**Executive Actions seem too generic?**
- This may indicate limited article quality or generic source material
- Use the Deep Dive tool for more specific recommendations
- Consider customizing the system prompt in Config to emphasize actionability
- Try a different persona—CTO/CISO often yield more specific actions than CEO

**Scores don't make sense?**
- Scores are relative to your current article set, not absolute
- A "3/5 Relevance" may still be highly relevant if few articles match
- Focus on the Strategic Relevance text, not just scores
- If consistently low scores, broaden your topic selection
